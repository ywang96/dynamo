//! Prometheus metric name constants and sanitization utilities
//!
//! This module provides centralized Prometheus metric name constants and sanitization functions
//! for various components to ensure consistency and avoid duplication across the codebase.
//!
//! ⚠️  **CRITICAL: REGENERATE PYTHON FILE AFTER CHANGES** ⚠️
//! When modifying constants in this file, regenerate the Python module:
//!     cargo run -p dynamo-codegen --bin gen-python-prometheus-names
//!
//! This generates `lib/bindings/python/src/dynamo/prometheus_names.py`
//! with pure Python constants (no Rust bindings needed).
//!
//! ## Naming Conventions
//!
//! All metric names should follow: `{prefix}_{name}_{suffix}`
//!
//! **Prefix**: Component identifier (`dynamo_component_`, `dynamo_frontend_`, etc.)
//! **Name**: Descriptive snake_case name indicating what is measured
//! **Suffix**:
//!   - Units: `_seconds`, `_bytes`, `_ms`, `_percent`, `_messages`, `_connections`
//!   - Counters: `_total` (not `total_` prefix) - for cumulative metrics that only increase
//!   - Gauges: No `_total` suffix - for current state metrics that can go up and down
//!   - Note: Do not use `_counter`, `_gauge`, `_time`, or `_size` in Prometheus names (too vague)
//!
//! **Common Transformations**:
//! - ❌ `_counter` → ✅ `_total`
//! - ❌ `_sum` → ✅ `_total`
//! - ❌ `_gauge` → ✅ (no suffix needed for current values)
//! - ❌ `_time` → ✅ `_seconds`, `_ms`, `_hours`, `_duration_seconds`
//! - ❌ `_time_total` → ✅ `_seconds_total`, `_ms_total`, `_hours_total`
//! - ❌ `_total_time` → ✅ `_seconds_total`, `_ms_total`, `_hours_total`
//! - ❌ `_total_time_seconds` → ✅ `_seconds_total`
//! - ❌ `_average_time` → ✅ `_seconds_avg`, `_ms_avg`
//! - ❌ `_size` → ✅ `_bytes`, `_total`, `_length`
//! - ❌ `_some_request_size` → ✅ `_some_request_bytes_avg`
//! - ❌ `_rate` → ✅ `_per_second`, `_per_minute`
//! - ❌ `disconnected_clients_total` → ✅ `disconnected_clients` (gauge, not counter)
//! - ❌ `inflight_requests_total` → ✅ `inflight_requests` (gauge, not counter)
//! - ❌ `connections_total` → ✅ `current_connections` (gauge, not counter)
//!
//! **Examples**:
//! - ✅ `dynamo_frontend_requests_total` - Total request counter (not `incoming_requests`)
//! - ✅ `dynamo_frontend_request_duration_seconds` - Request duration histogram (not `response_time`)
//! - ✅ `dynamo_component_errors_total` - Total error counter (not `total_errors`)
//! - ✅ `dynamo_component_memory_usage_bytes` - Memory usage gauge
//! - ✅ `dynamo_frontend_active_requests` - Current active requests gauge
//! - ✅ `dynamo_component_cpu_usage_percent` - CPU usage percentage
//! - ✅ `dynamo_frontend_tokens_per_second` - Token generation rate
//! - ✅ `dynamo_messaging_client_connection_duration_ms` - Connection time in milliseconds
//! - ✅ `dynamo_messaging_client_current_connections` - Current active connections gauge
//! - ✅ `dynamo_messaging_client_in_messages_total` - Total messages received counter
//!
//! ## Key Differences: Prometheus Metric Names vs Prometheus Label Names
//!
//! **Metric names**: Allow colons and `__` anywhere. **Label names**: No colons, no `__` prefix.
//! Label names starting with `__` are reserved for Prometheus internal use.
