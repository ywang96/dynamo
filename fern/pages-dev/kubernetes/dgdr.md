A `DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest` (DGDR) is Dynamo's **deploy-by-intent** API.
You describe what you want to run and your performance targets; the profiler
determines the optimal configuration and creates the live deployment.

For a step-by-step walkthrough of deploying your model — including strategy
selection, model caching, planner setup, and common pitfalls — see the
[Model Deployment Guide](model-deployment-guide.md).

## DGDR vs DGD

Dynamo provides two Custom Resources for deploying inference graphs:

| | DGDR (recommended) | DGD (manual) |
|---|---|---|
| **You provide** | Model + optional SLA targets | Full deployment spec (parallelism, replicas, resource limits, etc.) |
| **Profiling** | Automated — sweeps configurations to find optimal setup | None — you bring your own config |
| **Hardware portability** | Adapts to whatever GPUs are in your cluster | Tied to the hardware you configured for |
| **Best for** | Most deployments, SLA-driven optimization | Known-good configs, pinned recipes |

**When to use DGD instead**: Use DGD when you have a hand-crafted configuration
for a specific model/hardware combination (e.g., from `recipes/`). These configs
may be more optimal for known setups but require understanding of what
parallelism parameters (TP, PP, EP) are appropriate and don't generalize across
different hardware.

For DGD deployment details, see [Creating Deployments](deployment/create-deployment.md).

## Spec Reference

### Minimal Example

```yaml
apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1beta1
kind: DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest
metadata:
  name: my-model
spec:
  model: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
  image: "nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/dynamo-planner:1.1.1"  # dynamo-frontend for Dynamo < 1.1.0
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | Yes | — | HuggingFace model ID (e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`) |
| `image` | No | — | Container image for the profiling job. Dynamo >= 1.1.0: use `dynamo-planner`; earlier versions: use `dynamo-frontend`. |
| `backend` | No | `auto` | Inference engine: `auto`, `vllm`, `sglang`, `trtllm` |
| `searchStrategy` | No | `rapid` | Profiling depth: `rapid` (AIC simulation, ~30s) or `thorough` (real GPU, 2–4h) |

For the complete CRD spec, see the [API Reference](api-reference.md).

### Generated DGD Overrides

Use `spec.overrides.dgd` when the generated `DynamoGraphDeployment` needs a
field that DGDR does not expose directly. The value is a partial
`nvidia.com/v1alpha1` DGD object that is merged into the profiler-generated
deployment after Dynamo selects a configuration.

For example, to inject an environment variable into every generated service:

```yaml
apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1beta1
kind: DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest
metadata:
  name: qwen3-sglang
spec:
  model: Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B
  backend: sglang
  image: "nvcr.io/nvidia/ai-dynamo/dynamo-planner:1.1.1"  # dynamo-frontend for Dynamo < 1.1.0
  overrides:
    dgd:
      apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1alpha1
      kind: DynamoGraphDeployment
      spec:
        envs:
          - name: TRITON_PTXAS_PATH
            value: /usr/local/cuda/bin/ptxas
```

Use `spec.envs` for variables that should apply to all generated services. To
target a single service, override that service's `envs` entry instead:

```yaml
spec:
  overrides:
    dgd:
      apiVersion: nvidia.com/v1alpha1
      kind: DynamoGraphDeployment
      spec:
        services:
          decode:  # replace with the generated service name
            envs:
              - name: CUSTOM_WORKER_ENV
                value: "enabled"
```

<Note>
`overrides.profilingJob` only customizes the profiling Job. Use
`overrides.dgd` for settings that must appear on the deployed worker pods.
</Note>

### SKU Format

When providing hardware configuration manually, use lowercase underscore format:

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---|---|
| `h100_sxm` | `H100-SXM5-80GB` |
| `h200_sxm` | `H200-SXM-141GB` |
| `a100_sxm` | `A100-SXM4-80GB` |
| `a30` | `A30` |
| `l40s` | `L40S` |

All supported values: `gb200_sxm`, `b200_sxm`, `h200_sxm`, `h100_sxm`,
`h100_pcie`, `a100_sxm`, `a100_pcie`, `a30`, `l40s`, `l40`, `l4`,
`v100_sxm`, `v100_pcie`, `t4`, `mi200`, `mi300`.

<Note>
Not all SKUs are supported by the AIC profiler for `rapid` mode. See
[AIC Support Matrix](model-deployment-guide.md#aic-support-matrix) for details.
</Note>

<Info>
**PCIe variants not yet supported by profiler.** The CRD admits PCIe SKUs
(`h100_pcie`, `a100_pcie`, `v100_pcie`), but the profiler does not currently
ship training data for them. You can submit a DGDR with a PCIe value; the
operator will accept it but profiler-assisted sizing will fall back to
defaults. Profiler support for PCIe SKUs is tracked as an engineering
follow-up.
</Info>

## Lifecycle

When you create a DGDR, it progresses through these phases:

| Phase | What is happening |
|---|---|
| `Pending` | Spec validated; operator is discovering GPU hardware and preparing the profiling job |
| `Profiling` | Profiling job running — sub-phases: `Initializing`, `SweepingPrefill`, `SweepingDecode`, `SelectingConfig`, `BuildingCurves`, `GeneratingDGD`, `Done` |
| `Ready` | Profiling complete; optimal config stored in `.status.profilingResults.selectedConfig`. Terminal state when `autoApply: false`. |
| `Deploying` | Creating the `DynamoGraphDeployment` (only when `autoApply: true`) |
| `Deployed` | DGD is running and healthy |
| `Failed` | Unrecoverable error — profiling failures are not retried (`backoffLimit: 0`); check events and conditions for details |

### Conditions

The operator maintains these conditions on the DGDR status:

| Condition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Validation` | Spec validation passed or failed |
| `Profiling` | Profiling job is running, succeeded, or failed |
| `SpecGenerated` | Generated DGD spec is available |
| `DeploymentReady` | DGD is deployed and healthy |
| `Succeeded` | Aggregate condition — true when the DGDR has reached its target state |

### Monitoring

```bash
# Watch phase transitions
kubectl get dgdr my-model -n $NAMESPACE -w

# Detailed status, conditions, and events
kubectl describe dgdr my-model -n $NAMESPACE

# Profiling sub-phase
kubectl get dgdr my-model -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.status.profilingPhase}'

# Profiling job logs
kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE -l nvidia.com/dgdr-name=my-model
kubectl logs -f <profiling-pod-name> -n $NAMESPACE

# View generated DGD spec (when autoApply: false)
kubectl get dgdr my-model -n $NAMESPACE \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.profilingResults.selectedConfig}' | python3 -m json.tool

# View Pareto-optimal configs from profiling
kubectl get dgdr my-model -n $NAMESPACE \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.profilingResults.pareto}'
```

### Resource Ownership

- The DGDR does **not** set an owner reference on the DGD it creates. Deleting
  a DGDR does not delete the DGD — it persists independently so it can continue
  serving traffic.
- The relationship is tracked via labels: `dgdr.nvidia.com/name` and
  `dgdr.nvidia.com/namespace`.
- Additional resources (planner ConfigMaps) are created in the same namespace
  and labeled with `dgdr.nvidia.com/name`.

## Known Issues

- **`pareto_analysis.py` produces NaN for some configurations.** Tracked as an
  engineering follow-up. Workaround: re-run with a narrower sweep; narrow
  sweeps bypass the NaN path in practice.
- **PCIe profiler data not yet available.** See the PCIe callout under
  [SKU Format](#sku-format).
